# Bankrupcy-Prevention
## bankrupted-prediction-project
This repository contains materials related to predicting bankruptcy using machine learning techniques. The main focus is on analyzing data from bankruptcy-prevention.csv to build a model capable of identifying companies at risk of bankruptcy.
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a company will go bankrupt based on various factors such as industrial risk, management risk, financial flexibility, etc., extracted from the provided dataset.
## Dataset Description
The dataset bankruptcy-prevention.csv consists of 250 observations containing numerical values representing different risk factors for each company. Each observation belongs to one of two classes: bankruptcy or non-bankruptcy.
## Usage Instructions
Load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset better.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Build and train a classification model using appropriate algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, etc.
Evaluate the performance of the trained models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, etc.
Select the best performing model and save it for future predictions.
